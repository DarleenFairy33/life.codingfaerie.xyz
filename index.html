            <h2>United States of America</h2>
            <p>
                The United States of America, Consists of 50 states. Founded July 4, 1776.
                    <br>
                Now more than ever before we need to see change. As the whole world knows we recently had an election.
                    <br>
                Donald Trump won this election, while some people are happy, a lot of us are not, for many reasons.
                    <br>
                Donald trump winning means a lot for this country.
                    <br>
                We will lose a lot of things. such as womens rights & more. However, with the work of the american people, I do think we can see change in this country!

                Heres a Very Long list of things we will lose if trump puts <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">Project 2025</a> in place.

                <p>Now In NO Way Am I Trying To Scare You. I'm Spreading All The Information I have.</p>
                <p>With American democracy already at a crisis point, extreme right-wing operatives have crafted an authoritarian playbook that would push it over the edge, destroying the nation's 250-year-old bedrock system of checks and balances to create an imperial presidency.
                    The Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership is a 920-page road map for a future president to wield excessive power to implement a dangerous policy agenda, ripping out democracy by its roots and replacing it with a system that most Americans would find unthinkable</p>

                Palestine, Gained Independence on 15 November 1988
                    <br>
                As you may know Palestine is in a state of crisis & emergency.
                    <br>
                There is an ongoing conflict with Isreal.
                    <br>
                This will contain facts, and how to help.
            </p>
            <H2>The Facts.</H2>
            <p>
                The conflict has its origins in the rise of Zionism in Europe and the consequent first arrival of Jewish settlers to Ottoman Palestine in 1882.
                    <br>
                The local Arab population increasingly began to oppose Zionism, primarily out of fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.
